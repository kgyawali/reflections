How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I have learned to compare two files using terminal rather than eye bowling the whole content. It was quick and the errors were easy to find. 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Reading old codes teaches you how it was done and making changes and 
    helps to make new code but keeping old code pristine will help others to see the old codes and new codes and see the difference.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it helps users to locate and see changes in all related files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives all the commit that has been made with id as well as 
    message associated with it. 
    using git diff, we can compare differences between previous versions 
    of the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 It makes easier to find the bug in different versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use git for all programs that i think i need to make changes and collaborate with others. giT will save all our history as well as older codes.
